                    <h2>Hi, I'm Kiera</h2>
                    <div class="hometext"> <p> I am a Master’s student at Trinity College Dublin, studying Interactive Digital Media. While my work thus far has primarily focused on journalism, I am currently transitioning my focus to UX design and web development. <br> <br>
        
                        
                        I received my Bachelor of Arts in Communication and Media Studies from Saint Mary’s College of California in 2022 and have spent the last several years working for the Improve the News Foundation as an assistant editor for their publication Verity. In my work for Verity I write and edit, short and informative news briefs about current events and pressing issues. I am a passionate storyteller and a strong writer and enjoy writing both fiction and nonfiction. <br> <br>
        
                        
                         I am excited to combine my experience in journalism with my growing passion for digital design to create accessible, engaging experiences that put users first.  I am especially interested in UX design, where I can combine my creative abilities with problem-solving to create intuitive, inclusive, and accessible digital experiences. <br> <br>
                         In my freetime I enjoy hiking, kayaking, baking, and fiber arts.
